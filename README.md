# Mamba Long Range Arena

This repository contains some experiments for Mamba and its performance on the long range arena tasks.

A lot of the code here is taken from the repository [not-from-scratch](https://github.com/IdoAmos/not-from-scratch/) as well as [Mamba](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/tree/main) and [Long-Range-Arena](https://github.com/google-research/long-range-arena).
