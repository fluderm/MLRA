# Mamba Long Range Arena

This repository contains experiments for Mamba and its performance on the [long range arena (LRA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04006) tasks, as well as a few other experiments related to Mamba. 

A lot of the LRA code is taken from the repository [not-from-scratch](https://github.com/IdoAmos/not-from-scratch/) and [Long-Range-Arena](https://github.com/google-research/long-range-arena). We furthermore use the [Mamba](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/tree/main) block from the [Mamba paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752).
